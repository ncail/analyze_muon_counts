# Get OMNI data.


# Get muon data.


# Merge on datetime.


# For every 24 data points (24 hours), get amplitudes and phases using double harmonic fit.


    # Calculate sum of squared differences for each day of fitting.


# Plot amplitudes vs time, phases vs time, overlapping all correlation parameters and muon data.


# Calculate Pearson and Spearman coefficients between muon amps/phases and correlation parameters.
